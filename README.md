This project-based online course focuses on building a modern computer from first principles, starting from elementary logic gates and ending with a general-purpose computer.

Steps along the way:
- Elementary logic gates
- Arithmetic logic unit and RAM
- CPU, memory, Harvard architecture
- Assembly language and assembler
- VM and VM-to-assembly translation (in progress)
- Compilation (to be added)
- Operating system (to be added)
